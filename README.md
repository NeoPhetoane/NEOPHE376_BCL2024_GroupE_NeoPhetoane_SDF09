About project
The project is a CodeSpace footer that allows visitors to enter their email address and subscribe to the site. They can also navigate to the the quick links and tenchnologies that the site offers and it aslo has the logo at the bottom.

Comments
Css properties like ml(margin left) and bg(background) are shortened to have the same effect as normal css. Some custom tailwind css properties such as space-y is replacement for padding in normal Css.

Struggles
The overall project was not very difficult, it just required application of knowledge. The only thing that I struggled with was finding the tailwind replacement for padding which I eventually found on google. Another issue was creating spacing between the input field and the button.


Mastery point

I was able to complete the project with ease. The parts that I am now confident with are creating a list, enabling hover effect, creating spaces between items and using color.
